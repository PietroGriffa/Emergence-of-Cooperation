#  Emergence of Cooperation with Stationary Leaders

> * Group Name: cooperETHors
> * Group participants names: Griffa Pietro,  Hunhevicz Jens, Kerstan Sophie, Stolle Jonas
> * Project Title: Emergence of Cooperation with Stationary Leaders

## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

Study the emergence of cooperation, extending the model of Helbing et al. [1] towards stationary leadership by example [2].

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions



(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)

## Research Methods

This reserach is using Agent-Based Simulation to study the emergence of cooperation on a spatial grid. The underlying game theory mechanism is based on the Prisoners Dilemma. In addition to the standard interaction in their "Von-Neumann neighborhood", imitation, success-driven migration, and leadership is introduced. The work is based on the above references: [1], [2].

## Reproducibility

Please see the `README` in the `code` folder.
