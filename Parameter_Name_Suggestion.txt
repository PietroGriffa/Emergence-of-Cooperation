// all parameters from "Red Queen" and "Self Organization and Emergence..."

L Grid size, L^2 squares in grid
dt Time step		//this isn't actually needed, right?
t # Iterations   	//"iteration" equivalent to "game"

p_c % cooperators
p_d % defectors
p_l % loners

n_c # cooperators
n_d # defectors
n_l # loners

Pc payoff cooperators
Pd payoff defectors
Pl payoff loners, = sigma in Red Queen case

n # Players, n inbetween 0 and L^2

m # Interaction Partners, m = {4,8}
rho Density of Players, rho = n/(L^2)
M Mobility Range, (M+1)x(M+1) grid of movement
N # Focal Players		//number of players to be randomly chosen in each game
S # Focal Players without loners 	//the focal players that will actually play a game
q1 strategy mutations
q2 random relocations, 
q3 combination of q1 and q2

Prisoners Dilemma parameters: 
	Pij Payoff
	P11=R, P12=S, P21=t, P22=P, T>R>P>S
	Pi Overall Payoff 	//total payoff of a focal player after playing with all of his interaction partners
